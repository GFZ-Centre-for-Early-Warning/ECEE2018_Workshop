# Mapping exposure using expert judgment: the HAZUS case study

The use of faceted taxonomies such as the one proposed by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) has proved instrumental in collecting high quality building-by-building observations of the residential and commercial built environment. Yet, the inherent flexibility of this representation may hinder its full exploitation within large-scale seismic risk applications. A consistent mapping between taxonomic descriptions and risk-oriented vulnerability classes (e.g., HAZUS or PAGER-STR) may be implemented using an expert-based scoring methodology. In this special session an elicitation exercise will be presented in order to exemplify the methodology and derive an experimental mapping scheme to the HAZUS classification through the collaborative efforts of the participants.
